### Ever wondered how businesses tailor their strategies to meet the unique needs of their customers? ðŸŒŸ
 ### I recently built a customer segmentation model using K-Means Clustering, and it has been a game-changer in understanding customer behavior. Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

âœ… Analyzing Key Metrics: Using Annual Income*and Spending Score* I identified distinct customer groups. 
âœ… Elbow Method Magic: Found the optimal number of clusters , i.e. "4" by analyzing the "elbow point" on a WCSS graph. 
âœ… Visualizing Clusters: Created a scatter plot to make the data come aliveâ€”showing customer groups in vivid colors. 
âœ… Silhouette Scores: Ensured the clusters were well-defined for actionable insights.
